# Operating-systems-project-3

In this mini project I implemented my own memory allocation functions (dalloc and dfree) similar to C's malloc() and free(), using the guidance of Johan Montelius Next, previous, before and after document.

# How to use
Begin by cloning the repo then compiling the test.c file to see the functions in action, make sure to be in a Linux environment as these implemented functions are not designed to work on any other operating system.
